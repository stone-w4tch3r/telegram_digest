# Attempt 1 (python)

---

## 1. Initial prompt

#### Brief description

I need to create a simple application that will create a summary digest from multiple Telegram channels and send this digest daily to my email.

#### Features

- Simple web UI
  - Channels list
  - Settings
  - Digest history
  - Digest page
- Summary generation
  - Summarize posts from channels
  - Evaluate post quality and importance
  - Send summary preview to email
- Email sending
  - Email has only a link to the summary page and minimalistic text, to avoid issues with email rendering
- Telegram channels data
  - Channels are accessible via RSS feed
  - Automatic url generation as `https://rsshub.app/telegram/channel/channelname`
- Management and deployment
  - Settings are stored in json file

#### Technologies

- Python 13
- FastAPI
- Jinja2
- OpenAI API
- Pydantic
- RSSHub as a way to get RSS feed from Telegram channels
- Docker Compose

#### Code style and practices

- Type hints
- Pydantic models
- Static analysis (mypy)
- Linting (ruff)
- Formatting (black)
- Testing (pytest)
- Logging
- Error handling (global exception handlers)
- Readme and documentation
- Feature-based directory structure

#### Task

Now let's focus on high-level architecture of project. Project should be simple and time for implementation is one week. List components and their responsibilities and relations, use mermaid diagrams to visualize them.

---

## 2. Contracts

//previous response goes here

Based on our architecture, let's create contracts for each component. Use mermaid diagrams. Remember about code style and practices:

- Type hints
- Pydantic models
- Error handling (global exception handlers)

---

## 3. Contracts restart

Look at the description of an application that I am building:

//readme and architecture goes here

Based on our architecture, let's create contracts for each component. Use mermaid class diagrams syntax. Put all into one diagram. Remember about code style and practices:

- Type hints
- Pydantic models
- Error handling (global exception handlers)

---

## 4. Contracts improvement

Look at the description of an application that I am building:

//readme and architecture goes here

I have created a draft of contracts of an application.

//draft contracts goes here

Finish the contracts. If you have significant improvements, add them.

---

## 5. Implementation - project structure

Look at the description of an application that I am building:

//readme and architecture goes here

Create a project structure for the application. Do not create any files, just structure.

---

## 6. Implementation - files creation

Look at the description of an application that I am building:

//readme and architecture goes here

Create api.py, web_ui.py, models.py, summary_generator.py Use separate code blocks for each file.

Do not be lazy, write all the required code, do not leave any TODOs.

---

## 7. Implementation - files creation 2

Create email_service.py, scheduler.py, channels_repository.py, digests_repository.py.
Do not be lazy, write all the required code, do not leave any TODOs.

---

## 8. Implementation - files creation 3

Create database.py, channel_reader.py, logger.py, settings.py.

Do not be lazy, write all the required code, do not leave any TODOs.

---

## 9. Implementation - files creation 4

Cool! Now let's create html templates for the web UI.

First create base.html, channels.html and style.css.

Look at api.py and web_ui.py to understand how to create templates.

---

## 10. Implementation - files creation 5

Yes, create digest_history.html, settings.html and digest_page.html.

Look at api.py and web_ui.py to understand how to create templates.

---

## 11. Implementation - logo

Look at description of an application that I am building:

//readme goes here

Create a simple svg logo for it. Give me three different versions, describe them.

---

# Attempt 2 (C#)

---

## 1. Initial prompt

Look at the description of an application that I am building:

//readme goes here (but without contracts)

It was initially planned to be implemented in Python, but I have decided to switch to C#.
Please rewrite architecture for C#, based on provided list of technologies and approaches.

---

## 2. Initial prompt, attempt 2

Look at the description of an application that I am building. Draw a mermaid diagram of the application architecture.

//updated readme goes here (but without contracts)

---

## 3. Contracts

Look at the description of an application that I am building. Create contracts for each component. Use mermaid class diagrams syntax. Put all into one diagram.

//readme goes here

## 4. Libraries

Look at the description of an application that I am building. Suggest a list of libraries for my application.

//readme goes here

## 5. Structure creation

Look at the description of an application that I am building. Create a project structure (files and folders) for the application. Do not create any files, just structure.

//readme goes here

## 6. Structure review

Look at the description of an application that I am building. Review the project structure (files and folders) and suggest improvements if needed.

//readme goes here

## 7. Files creation - 1

Look at the description of an application that I am building.

//readme goes here

Create files for the application:

- Models.cs
- IdStructs.cs
- ChannelReader.cs
- ChannelsService.cs

## 8. Files creation - 2

Create files for the application:

- ChannelsRepository.cs
- DigestsService.cs
- SummaryGenerator.cs
- DigestRepository.cs

From now on, use XML comments for all the code, but do not comment the obvious.

## 9. Files creation - 3

Create files for the application:

- EmailSender.cs
- SettingsManager.cs
- MainService.cs
- Dtos.cs

## 10. Files creation - 4

Create files for the application:

- Entities.cs
- Configuration.cs
- DbContext.cs
- Program.cs

## 11. Files creation - 5

Create files for the application:

- PublicFacade.cs
- appsettings.json
- TelegramDigest.Application.csproj
- Directory.Build.props
- TelegramDigest.sln
